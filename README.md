# Firebase QuotaExceededError: Transient Spike Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to Firebase Realtime Database quota limits. Even with seemingly low data usage, rapid small updates can cause transient quota spikes leading to `QuotaExceededError`s. The error messages aren't always helpful in diagnosing the root cause.  The `quotaSpikeBug.js` file reproduces this problem, while `quotaSpikeSolution.js` offers potential solutions.

## Problem:

The problem lies in the fact that Firebase's quota system is not just about overall data storage; it also considers the rate of write operations. A series of small, frequent updates can momentarily exceed the quota, even if the total data size remains within limits.

## Solution:

The solution involves strategies to batch updates, limit the frequency of writes, or utilize other Firebase services better suited for high-volume updates.  `quotaSpikeSolution.js` provides examples of batching updates using transactions to reduce the overall number of write operations.  Consider using Firestore for potentially higher throughput.
